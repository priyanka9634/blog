-- ds.h1: MOMENT OF COUPLE

-- ds.markdown:

-	**Moment of a couple** - Another method of achieving rotational movements. 
-	**Couple** - is two parallel forces of equal magnitude acting in opposite directions and separated by a distance (i.e. different lines of action). 
-	The magnitude of a couple is calculated by multiplying the magnitude of force(s) by the distance between them; the units are also in gram-millimeters. 
-	Couple results in pure rotational movement of the object regardless of the point of application of the forces.
